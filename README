SLOG "status logging"

An "RRD-like" mechanism for storing "diff logs" --- basically log
entries indicating status changes.  It uses a sqlite backend.
Whenever an update occurs, it is _only_ stored in the database if
there is a change from the preceding log entry.

There are Perl and PHP libraries here.  There is also an example
application, makespark.pl, that generates "sparkline" graphs from data
spanning multiple SLOGs with some specific server status data.  The
example data is reachability data to a specific server from a variety
of monitoring locations and includes status values of "up", "down",
"nodns" (DNS lookup failed), and "unknown".  Try running
`./makespark.pl slog/*.slog` to generate a simple "sparkline" with
rows corresponding to monitoring locations, x-axis as time, and color
coding of status.
